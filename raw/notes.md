# Notes


## Data:

> wordlist of basic vocabulary was used in this project. The list includes culturally neutral items
> that are universally lexicalized and that frequently appear in wordlists. The wordlist is given
> in 1 below. Many items also appear in the Swadesh 100 (Swadesh 1971) and 200 list (see, for
> example, Crowley & Bowern 2010). Additional words added here are asterisked. Our list was based
> on the list used in Greenhill et al. 2008, which was in turn based on Blust 1981, 2000. The
> original list was 204 items. This was subsequently reduced to 189 items. We removed some words
> (such as numerals above five) that were not useful for studying Australian languages. Some words
> from our original list were subsequently excluded, and are given here in italics.
